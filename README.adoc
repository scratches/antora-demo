This project demonstrate how to build https://docs.antora.org/[Antora] docs from Maven. Antora is a Node.js utility so we can use the https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin[Front End Plugin] and some https://www.npmjs.com/[npm] configuration.

## Building the Site

To see it working, clone this repository and then on the command line:

```
$ ./mvnw install
```

Then visit the generated site at `build/site/index.html`. You can rebuild using Maven (compile goal) or using the `npm` utility script and the "build" script configured in `package.json`:

```
$ ./npm run build 

> docs@1.0.0 build /home/dsyer/dev/spring/docs-test/docs
> antora --stacktrace generate --url https://cloud.spring.io antora-playbook.yml

Site generation complete!
View the site by visiting file:///home/.../build/site in a browser.
```

## What's in the Box?

The build is configured in the `antora-playbook.yml`. It starts like this:

```yaml
site:
  title: Spring
  start_page: spring-cloud::index.adoc
```

The `start_page` is optional, but useful - if you don't have one the site has no "home page". The site home page is just a redirect to the home page of one of the components ("spring-cloud").

The components are defined in a directory with a conventional layout. It has to contain `antora.yml` and a `modules` directory. An example can be seen in the "main" branch of this project. Here is `antora.yml`:

```yaml
name: spring-cloud
title: Spring Cloud
version: ~
display-version: x.x.y
```

The `modules` directory contains "packages", one of which is optionally "ROOT". The ROOT package goes in the "home" of the component. A package can have Asciidoctor sources in its "pages" directory. So this is a minimal component:

```
$ find modules
modules
modules/ROOT
modules/ROOT/pages
modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc
```

The repository has 4 branches, and each one is an Antora "component". 2 of the branches (`main` and `old`) are displayed as versions "x.x.y" and "y.y.y" of the same component. The other branches are different components. For a "real" project it is likely that these would pull in content from other repositories. All 4 branches are pulled into the `antor-playbook.yml` in one section:

```yaml
content:
  sources:
    - url: .
      branches: [main, old, function, stream]
```

The "ui" is what controls the page layout and user interactions, like version pickers, etc. This example uses a ui developed for https://spring.io:

```yaml
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://github.com/spring-io/antora-ui-spring/releases/download/latest/ui-bundle.zip
    snapshot: true
```

## Navigation

Each component has a `nav.adoc` for navigation - it's a list of cross references and links that show up in the nav section (on the left in the Spring UI layout). It can be composed from multiple modules, but all of them have to be in the same component.

There is also a default navigation with all versions of all components. The custom navigations give the author the chance to control which versions link to which other components. The demo site has been laid out as a hierarchy - "spring-cloud" is a collection of other components (projects) with specified versions. Each component has its own internal navigation, but the UI always has breadcrumbs within the current component and a link back to the top level (the "home" icon).
