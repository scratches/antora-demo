This project demonstrate how to build https://docs.antora.org/[Antora] docs from Maven. Antora is a Node.js utility so we can use the https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin[Front End Plugin] and some https://www.npmjs.com/[npm] configuration.

To see it working, clone this repository and then on the command line:

```
$ ./mvnw install
```

Then visit the generated site at `build/site/index.html`. You can rebuild using Maven (compile goal) or using the `npm` utility script and the "build" script configured in `package.json`:

```
$ ./npm run build 

> docs@1.0.0 build /home/dsyer/dev/spring/docs-test/docs
> antora --stacktrace generate --url https://cloud.spring.io antora-playbook.yml

Site generation complete!
View the site by visiting file:///home/.../build/site in a browser.
